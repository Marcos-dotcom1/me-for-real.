I’m someone with a deep love for music, art, and self-expression. My music taste is diverse, with a strong focus on rock,
 though I enjoy a bit of everything. I draw heavy inspiration from guitar legends like Steve Vai and Tim Henson, blending their
  unique styles into my own playing. My connection with music goes beyond just listening—it's about the creativity and individuality it allows me to express.

When it comes to art, I’m captivated by works that evoke emotion and depth, like Van Gogh’s Starry Night or the quiet solitude
 of Friedrich’s The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog. These pieces reflect my own sense of introspection and the beauty of solitude.
  I see art as a way to explore and express deeper truths about who I am.

My style is another important form of self-expression. I lean toward street style with a touch of alt influence—think Starboy-inspired vibes,
 but with a minimalist twist. I love clothes that feel personal and unique, without being too over-the-top. It’s about finding that balance between 
 being bold and understated.

Photography is another creative outlet I enjoy. Whether it’s capturing the details of a city or moments that feel particularly significant,
 photography helps me freeze time and reflect on the little things that often go unnoticed. It’s all about seeing the world through my lens and 
 finding beauty in the everyday.
